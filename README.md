# The Green Gnome without his beard.

Cock-a-doodle-dooooo!
That fucking cock of the neighbours Willyfred & June. Every morning, way too early.
Fred threw himself out of bed, stomped to the window and was ready to throw his shoe at the miserable beast.

"that goddamn sunlight..." he groans while weeping his eyes... He looks behind him *she is still sleeping... good! I wouldn't be able to take that too* he thinks.

Willyfred loves eating June's pancakes every morning, but this one friday morning he sensed a weird smell coming from his first pancake.
At first Willyfred thought it might have been the milk, but June just opened a new carton this morning. 
Maybe it had something to do with the eggs they got from the neighbours, Harald and Shereen.
