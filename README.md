# The Green Gnome without his beard.

Cock-a-doodle-dooooo!
That fucking cock of the neighbours Willyfred & June. Every morning, way too early.
Fred threw himself out of bed, stomped to the window and was ready to throw his shoe at the miserable beast.

"that goddamn sunlight..." he groans while weeping his eyes... He looks behind him *she is still sleeping... good! I wouldn't be able to take that too* he thinks.
